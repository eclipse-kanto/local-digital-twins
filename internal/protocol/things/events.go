// Event represents a message entity defined by the Ditto protocol for the Things group that defines a notification for a change that happened.
// This is a special Message that is always bound to a specific Thing instance along with providing the capabilities to configure:
// - the type of the change that happened - Created, Modified, Deleted
// - the channel used for the notification - Twin, Live
// - the entity that was affected - the whole Thing (the default), all features of the Thing (Features),
//                               a single Feature of the Thing (Feature), all attributes of the Thing (Attributes) or
//                               a single attribute of the Thing (Attribute), the Thing's policy (PolicyID)
//                               or the Thing's definition (Definition).
// Note: Only one change type can be configured to the event - if using the methods for configuring it - only the last one applies.
// Note: Only one channel can be configured to the event - if using the methods for configuring it - only the last one applies.
// Note: Only one entity that will b affected by the event can be configured - if using the methods for configuring it - only the last one applies.
